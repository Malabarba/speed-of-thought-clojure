;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   This defines a new local minor-mode `sotclojure-mode', which is
;;   activated by the global `speed-of-thought-mode' on any clojure
;;   buffers.
;;
;;   The mode is quite simple, and is composed of two parts:
;;
;; 1.1 Abbrevs
;; ───────────
;;
;;   A large number of abbrevs which expand function initials to their
;;   name. A few examples:
;;
;;   • wl -> when-let [|]
;;   • n -> not
;;   • wo -> with-open
;;   • np -> number? (the p stands for predicate)
;;   • ck -> :keys [|] (the c stands for colon)
;;
;;   Note that, in order to avoid frustration, the 1-letter abbrevs will
;;   only expand after a `(' or after a `/', so you can still use 1-letter
;;   local variables like `a' and `n'.
;;
;; 1.2 Commands
;; ────────────
;;
;;   It also defines 4 commands, which really fit into this "follow the
;;   thought-flow" way of writing. The bindings are as follows:
;;   `M-RET': Break line, and insert `()' with point in the middle.
;;   `C-RET': Do `forward-up-list', then do M-RET.
;;
;;   Hitting RET followed by a `(' was one of the most common key sequences
;;   for me while writing elisp, so giving it a quick-to-hit key was a
;;   significant improvement.
;;
;;   `C-c f': Find function under point. If it is not defined, create a
;;   definition for it below the current function and leave point inside.
;;
;;   With these commands, you just write your code as you think of it. Once
;;   you hit a “stop-point” of sorts in your tought flow, you hit `C-c f/v'
;;   on any undefined functions/variables, write their definitions, and hit
;;   `C-u C-SPC' to go back to the main function.
;;
;; 1.3 Small Example
;; ─────────────────
;;
;;   With the above (assuming you use something like paredit or
;;   electric-pair-mode), if you write:
;;
;;   ┌────
;;   │ (wl SPC {ck SPC x C-f C-RET (a SPC (np SPC y C-f SPC f SPC y
;;   └────
;;
;;   You get
;;
;;   ┌────
;;   │ (when-let [{:keys [x]}
;;   │            (and (number? y) (first y))])
;;   └────
